# Unit Testing
  
* Test save & delete functions
  - '#save' should save data
  - '#save' should update existing data
  - '#delete' should delete data 
  - '#delete' should not fail if data does not exist

# Middlewares

Using the code and repo from last weeks TP and enhanced in class

* Fully implement User module: auth, CRUD & unit tests
* Using the `metrics` module implemented on past work:
  * Link metrics to users 
  * Implement the mechanisms for a user to add metrics and retrieve them (only its own !)
* On the front-end:
  * Display data accordingly to the connected user
  * Allow a user to display each of his metrics group

Notes :

This work is part of the continuous assessment of this class and will be the basis for your final project
